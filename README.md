# Light-Following-Robot
developing an autonomous robot capable of following light and avoiding obstacles using an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller, Light Dependent Resistors (LDR), and Ultrasonic sensors. The robot aims to navigate safely in environments hazardous to humans, leveraging LDRs to detect light intensity and Ultrasonic sensors to measure distances to obstacles.
